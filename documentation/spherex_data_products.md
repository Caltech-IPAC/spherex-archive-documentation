# SPHEREx Data Products

IRSA began releasing SPHEREx Spectral Image data on a weekly basis in July 2025 (Quick Release 1; QR1).
In October 2025, IRSA began distributing SPHEREx Spectral Image data processed with substantially improved calibrations.
This new processing, referred to as QR2, includes reprocessed versions of all Spectral Image data acquired since the start of the mission.
Future quick releases will also use the QR2 pipeline.
IRSA will continue to provide access to QR1 data for reference.
However, QR2 supersedes QR1 and will be the default returned in the SPHEREx Data Explorer and by all IRSA program-friendly APIs.
QR1 data will remain available only through browsable directory listings.

A detailed description of SPHEREx quick release data products available to the public is provided in the [SPHEREx Explanatory Supplement](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPHEREx/docs/SPHEREx_Expsupp_QR.pdf).
Here we provide a concise summary of the science, calibration, and additional data products available at IRSA.
This summary includes filenaming conventions, for which we adopt the following definitions:

- `Planning Period` designates the survey plan uploaded to the spacecraft, e.g. `2025W18_2B`.
Each planning period covers approximately 3.5 days of operation.

- `Observation ID` includes the survey planning period and the large and small slew counters.
For example, `2025W18_2B_0001_1` contains the planning period (`2025W18_2B`), the large slew counter (`0001`), and the small slew counter (`1`).
Each large slew has a maximum of 4 small slews, so the allowed small slew counter range is 1 to 4.
Some large slews will have fewer than 4 small slews.

- `Detector` is an integer from 1 through 6.

- `Version` is the version of this file, e.g. 'l2' for "level 2" data products.

- `Processing Date` includes the year and the number of days into the year, e.g. `2025-164`.


## Main Science Data Product: Spectral Image Multi-Extension FITS Files (MEF)

The main Quick Release data product is the Level 2 Spectral Image MEF,as described in Section 2.1 of the [Explanatory Supplement](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPHEREx/docs/SPHEREx_Expsupp_QR.pdf).

There are 6 Spectral MEFs (one for each detector) for each sky pointing.
Because data quality assessments are evaluated per spectral image band, some observations will not include all 6 bands in the archive.
Each Spectral MEF is approximately 70 MB and contains 6 extensions:

HDU 1: IMAGE
 : Calibrated surface brightness flux density in units of MJy/sr, stored as a 2040 x 2040 image.
   No zodiacal light subtraction is applied.
   

   The SPHEREx focal plane is split with a dichroic to three short-wavelength and three long-wavelength detector arrays.
   Two focal plane assemblies (FPAs) simultaneously image the sky through a dichroic beam splitter.
   Each FPA contains three 2K x 2K detector arrays placed behind a set of linear variable filters (LVFs), providing narrow-band response with a band center that varies along one axis of the array.
   SPHEREx obtains spectra through multiple exposures, placing a given source at multiple positions in the field of view, where it is measured at multiple wavelengths by repointing the spacecraft.

   * Band 1: λ= 0.75 - 1.09 µm; R=39
   * Band 2: λ= 1.10 - 1.62 µm; R=41
   * Band 3: λ= 1.63 - 2.41 µm; R=41
   * Band 4: λ= 2.42 - 3.82 µm; R=35
   * Band 5: λ= 3.83 - 4.41 µm; R=112
   * Band 6: λ= 4.42 - 5.00 µm; R=128

HDU 2: FLAGS
 : Bitmap of per-pixel status and processing flags, stored as a 2040 x 2040 image.
   The definition of the flags are provided in Table 10 of the [SPHEREx Explanatory Supplement](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/SPHEREx/docs/SPHEREx_Expsupp_QR.pdf).

HDU 3: VARIANCE
 : Variance of calibrated surface brightness flux in units of (MJy/sr)^2, stored as a 2,040 x 2,040 image.

HDU 4: ZODI
 : Modeled zodiacal light background flux in units of MJy/sr, stored as a 2040 x 2040 image.
   This has not been subtracted from the IMAGE extension.

HDU 5: PSF
 : 121 Point-spread functions (PSFs); each PSF is represented as a 101 x 101 image and all 121 are assembled together into a cube.

HDU 6: WCS-WAVE
 : Spectral World Coordinate System (WCS) FITS-compliant lookup table that maps spectral image pixel coordinates to central wavelengths and bandwidths.
   The lookup table consists of 1 row with 3 columns (X, Y, VALUES).


   X and Y are each arrays defining a grid of control points in spectral image pixel space.


VALUES is an array of two-element arrays: at each (X, Y) control point, the two-element array contains the central wavelength and the corresponding bandwidth.

   :::{note}
   Adopted to support the unique nature of the SPHEREx LVF filters, this rarely-used part of the FITS standard has yet to be implemented by all readers.

   If your FITS client software doesn't automatically recognize this WCS-WAVE, you can manually determine the central wavelength or bandwidth at an arbitrary pixel location by identifying the four nearest control points and applying bilinear interpolation.
   This method yields values accurate to within approximately 1 nm.
   The information in the WCS-WAVE extension of the Spectral Image MEF is also provided in a stand-alone data product described below in [](#data-products-spectral-wcs).
   The fidelity of the WCS-WAVE lookup table is intended for visualization purposes.
   For science analysis, use the CWAVE and CBAND extensions in the Spectral WCS calibration product.

## Cutouts of Spectral Image MEFs

IRSA's Cutout Service provides spatial subsets of the SPHEREx Spectral Image MEFs.
Information on how to use the Cutout Service is provided in the [Data Access](https://caltech-ipac.github.io/spherex-archive-documentation/spherex-data-access#cutouts-of-spherex-spectral-image-mefs) section of this User Guide.
The cutout MEFs returned from this service contain the same HDUs as the original Spectral Images (IMAGE, FLAGS, VARIANCE, ZODI, PSF, WCS-WAVE). However, the IMAGE, FLAGS, VARIANCE, AND ZODI HDUs have been modified to include only those pixels within the specified cutout size.
The WCS-WAVE HDU has also modified to provide the correct mapping between the pixels in the cutout to wavelength.
The PSF HDU from the original spectral image is included unmodified in the cutout MEF.

The spatially-varying PSF is represented as an image cube with 121 planes.
Each plane is a 101x101 pixel image representing a PSF for a different region of the detector. Users interested in performing photometry on a cutout using the information in the cutout PSF HDU will need to understand how to find the most applicable PSF cube plane for each pixel in the cutout.
The basic steps are described below, and a [Python notebook tutorial](https://caltech-ipac.github.io/irsa-tutorials/) is provided to help users get started with a simple implementation.

1. Determine the 0-based pixel coordinates of the position of interest in the IMAGE HDU of the cutout.

2. Determine the 0-based pixel coordinates of the position of interest in the IMAGE HDU of the original Spectral Image.

```
xpix_orig = 1 + xpix_cutout - CRPIX1A
ypix_orig = 1 + ypix_cutout - CRPIX2A
```

3. Examine the header of the PSF HDU of the cutout to determine the PSF zone and cube plane corresponding to the pixel of interest in the original Spectral Image.

The PSF HDU has a header containing the keywords `XCTR_*`, `YCTR_*`, `XWID_*`, and `YWID_*`, where * goes from [1 to 121].
To determine if a pixel in the original Spectral Image falls within a PSF zone, simply find the closest `XCTR_*` and `YCTR_*` to determine the cube plane that contains the corresponding PSF for this zone.

## Calibration Product: Absolute Gain Matrix

Each PSF is a two-dimensional array with size of 101 × 101 pixels.
The PSFs are oversampled such that 10 PSF pixels cover the same spatial extent as one spectral image pixel (0.615 arcsec).

## Additional Product: Spectral WCS

The Spectral WCS products are ~32 MB multi-extension FITS files (one per detector).
Each file has 3 extensions: CWAVE, CBAND, and WCS-WAVE.

CWAVE is an image with dimensions 2,040 x 2,040.
It contains the central wavelength in microns for each pixel.

CBAND is an image with dimensions 2,040 x 2,040.
It contains the bandwidth in microns for each pixel.

WCS-WAVE is a table with 3 columns (X, Y, VALUES) and 1 row.
This is equivalent to the WCS-WAVE extension in the Spectral Image MEF file described above.
